# Nausea Dungeon
This is a spin-off project of the Nausea codebase, which can be found here;

This project uses a custom version of the Unreal Engine 4.27 (Chaos) that can be found as a fork of that engine version here:
https://github.com/accessednullptr/Unreal-Engine-4.27-Nausea

These changes are required to compile Nausea-Dungeon successfully.
